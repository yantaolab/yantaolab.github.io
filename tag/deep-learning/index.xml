      <title>Automatic repetitive action counting for construction worker ergonomic assessment</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The construction industry around the globe has unsatisfactory occupational health and safety records. One of the major reasons is attributed to high physical demands and hostile working environments. Construction work always requires workers to work for a long duration without sufficient breaks to recover from overexertion and to work under harsh climatic conditions and/or in confined workspaces. Such circumstances can increase the risk of physical fatigue. Traditionally, fatigue monitoring in the construction domain relies on self-reporting or subjective questionnaires. These methods require the manual collection of responses and are impractical for continuous fatigue monitoring. Some researchers have used on-body sensors for fatigue monitoring (such as heart rate monitors and surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors). Although these devices appear to be promising, they are intrusive, requiring sensors to be attached to the worker&amp;rsquo;s body. Such on-body sensors are uncomfortable to wear and could easily cause irritation. Considering the limitations of these methodologies, the current research proposes a novel non-intrusive method to monitor the whole-body physical fatigue with computer vision for construction workers. A computer vision-based 3D motion capture algorithm was developed to model the motion of various body parts using an RGB camera. A fatigue assessment model was developed using the 3D model data from the developed motion capture algorithm and biomechanical analysis. The experiment showed that the proposed physical fatigue assessment method could provide joint-level physical fatigue assessments automatically. Then, a series of experiments demonstrated the potential of the method in assessing the physical fatigue level of different construction task conditions such as site layout and the work-rest schedules.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning multi-granular worker intentions from incomplete visual observations for worker-robot collaboration in construction</title>
      <link>https://yantaolab.github.io/project/intention/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recognizing a worker&amp;rsquo;s intentions is an important prerequisite to enable smooth human-robot collaboration in construction. However, the highly dynamic construction workplace and long-horizon construction tasks prevent robots from obtaining long-term observations, which is detrimental to information accumulation and intention disambiguation. We present (1) a data and knowledge fusion strategy that combines visual contextual information and task knowledge to reduce the information loss caused by incomplete observations, and (2) a multi-granularity worker intent recognition model to explore the optimal granularity by comparing the intent modeling capabilities of different granularities. Results show that the proposed method can recognize multi-granular worker intentions with macro-F1 scores higher than 0.85, and that the intermediate activity is the best-suited granularity as it strikes a good balance between intention recognition accuracy and intention modeling capability.

      <title>Recovering Building Information Model from 2D Drawings for Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing Systems of Ageing Buildings</title>
      <link>https://yantaolab.github.io/project/mep2bim/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ageing buildings have become a significant concern for many cities, exacerbated by inadequate management and maintenance of Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing (MEP) systems, and Building Information Modelling (BIM) enables efficient MEP Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;amp;M) through the digital representation of system information; however, many ageing buildings were constructed without BIM, and manual reconstruction is costly and inefficient due to the sheer number of such structures. Although some studies have proposed methods for automatically recovering BIM from 2D drawings, few are suitable for MEP systems due to the multiscale and irregular shapes of MEP components. To fill this gap, an automatic approach is proposed for recovering MEP BIM from 2D drawings with three modules: 1) semantic extraction by combining image cropping with Cascade Mask R-CNN to detect and segment multiscale, irregular MEP components; 2) geometric extraction by semantic-assisted image processing to extract contours and skeletons of irregular parts; and 3) Industry Foundation Class (IFC)-based BIM reconstruction via the open-source pythonOCC and IfcOpenShell. The performance was tested on two MEP systems with 335 and 282 multiscale and irregular elements, and the results show that the method recovered BIMs for the two MEP systems in 2.85 seconds and 0.79 seconds, with semantic extraction accuracy exceeding 0.9 and geometric error below 5%. This paper contributes to the existing body of knowledge by providing a semantic and geometric-based approach for recovering multiscale and irregular components from 2D drawings. Future studies could further improve the approach by integrating elevation drawings, reconstructing abstract symbols, and aligning text-geometry. &lt;strong&gt;For more details, please read our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0926580523001747&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, and code is available &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/CrossStyle/MEP2BIM&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
