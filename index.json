Many construction tasks typically result in accidents and work musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD). The heavy workload will affect the safety and health of workers and will also exacerbate the labor shortage in the construction industry in many countries and regions, including Hong Kong. The exoskeleton, as a wearable external mechanical structure, may benefit workers by reducing their physical workload and improving their productivity. My research focuses on developing a biomechanical digital twin to assist the individualized design of exoskeletons for construction workers.\nThis research would apply a non-intrusive method to collect the kinematic data and establish a musculoskeletal model for construction workers. The method combines computer vision technology which is a 3D motion capture algorithm using an RGB camera and smart insoles for construction workers which is capable of monitoring the reaction force of feet generated by a work pattern. The potential, feasibility, and applicability of industrial exoskeletons applied to construction workers will be analyzed. Based on the musculoskeletal model, the biomechanical analysis will be carried out to identify exceptionally loaded positions, analyze representative muscle groups and joint loads of each pose representative of the model, find over-strained body areas and add exoskeletons. Then propose a model-based framework will be proposed to optimize and evaluate the individual exoskeleton design for construction workers. And, using the model-based approach to extend worker actions from poses to movement sequences.

Workers are also exposed to higher risks at low light due to dazzling lights and fatigable low-light environments. Estimating human pose can help assess workload and reduce the risk of fatigue and injury in low light. However, the existing method cannot accurately identify the Workers’ pose in the low light environment. As a result, this paper proposes an Unsupervised Illumination Reflectance Estimation Network (UIRE-Net) framework for estimating Workers’ poses in low light. The image restoration method is based on the Retinex theory, in which objects’ true color is determined solely by illumination reflectance. To begin, the Retinex method recovers the information from low-light images. The Workers’ pose estimation module is then used to track the worker’s pose. The proposed method’s pose estimation performance is evaluated using 200 low-light construction images and over 1000 Workers’ pose estimation experiments. The results show that UIRE-Net has a recognition rate of 77.9%. In the low-light construction scenario, the proposed method outperforms the baseline method by 17.8%. To improve productivity and safety performance, UIRE-Net can estimate Workers’ pose in low light and assist in completing automatic monitoring tasks in low-light construction.\n","date":1673740800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673740800,"objectID":"81cd2bbcca64c18b1ec69bbd9bdb50d6","permalink":"https://yantaolab.github.io/project/lowlight/","publishdate":"2023-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/lowlight/","section":"project","summary":"A research about low light enhancement, construction workers' pose estimation, and occupational safety and health","tags":["Construction worker pose estimation","Low light enhancement","Occupational safety and health"],"title":"Vision-based low-light construction workers' pose analysis","type":"project"},{"authors":["Hongling Guo","Ying Zhou","Zaiyi Pan","Zhitian Zhang","Yantao Yu","Yan Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1651190400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651190400,"objectID":"5aa7f3d6650d8c9c0c33a4d420a9ce56","permalink":"https://yantaolab.github.io/publication/hongling20220429buildings/","publishdate":"2022-04-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hongling20220429buildings/","section":"publication","summary":"Accurate selection and location of mobile cranes is a critical issue on construction sites, being able to contribute to the improvement of the safety and efficiency of lifting operations. Considering the complexities and dynamics of construction sites, this study aimed to develop a useful approach for automated selection and localization of mobile cranes based on the simulation of crane operations. First, the information required for crane selection and localization is analyzed and extracted from BIM (building information modeling). Then, mainly considering the crane capacity, the initial crane type is selected with candidate location points. Based on the simulation of lifting operation at the candidate points, feasible location points and crane types are determined through three constraint checks (i.e., environment constraint, operation constraint, and safety constraint). Besides, two kinds of efficiency optimization, namely lifting time minimization and crane movement minimization, are presented to figure out the best location points from the feasible points. Finally, the proposed approach is validated using a case study. This research contributes to not only crane operation planning but also automatic construction simulation, thus supporting the implementation of intelligent construction in the future.","tags":[],"title":"Automated Selection and Localization of Mobile Cranes in Construction Planning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Waleed Umer","Yantao Yu","Maxwell Fordjour Antwi-Afari","Li Jue","Mohsin K.

Internet of Things (IoT)-based techniques have been introduced to collect 3-D pose data. Though previous studies have yielded significant results, researchers have yet to use 3-D pose estimation in real-life applications. Since wearable sensors might be intrusive and infrared depth cameras are sensitive to sunlight, monocular-camera-based computer vision algorithms provide a possible solution. Previous algorithms are trained and tested with simple daily postures. There are industrial scenarios where the poses are more complex and irregular. An example is the poses of workers on construction sites, such as lifting, climbing, and rebar tying. These postures differ drastically from daily postures and vary from person to person. For instance, some workers prefer bending rebar tying, while others prefer squatting rebar tying. As a result, the previous monocular-camera-based-3-D poses estimation methods have proved to be inapplicable to industrial scenarios. Thus, this article developed a monocular-camera-based 3-D estimation method which is suitable for industry working poses. A residual artificial neural network (RANN) with flexible complexity and weighted training loss was designed. A 3-D pose data set, which consists of diversified working poses in worksites, was built to test the performance of the network in complex scenarios. Compared with previous 3-D pose capture methods, the mean per joint position error was reduced by 31.42%. The latency was 0.24 s. Thus, we conclude that the proposed monocular-camera-based method has great potential in industrial application scenarios.","tags":[],"title":"Three-Dimensional Working Pose Estimation in Industrial Scenarios With Monocular Camera","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yantao Yu","Waleed Umer","Xincong Yang","Maxwell Fordjour Antwi-Afari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1611273600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611273600,"objectID":"c3b821b328712cefaffcda9a538ff1fd","permalink":"https://yantaolab.github.io/publication/yantao20210122autcon/","publishdate":"2021-01-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yantao20210122autcon/","section":"publication","summary":"Construction workers' posture-related data is closely connected with their safety, health, and productivity performance.

However, few studies have focused on the automated recognition of overexertion-related construction workers' activities as well as assessing ergonomic risk levels, which may help to minimize WMSDs. Therefore, this study examined the feasibility of using acceleration and foot plantar pressure distribution data captured by a wearable insole pressure system for automated recognition of overexertion-related construction workers' activities and for assessing ergonomic risk levels. The proposed approach was tested by simulating overexertion-related construction activities in a laboratory setting.

Cross-validation results showed that the Random Forest classifier with a 2.56-s window size achieved the best classification accuracy of 98.3% and a sensitivity of more than 95.8% for each category of activities using the best features of combined data set. Furthermore, the estimation of corresponding ergonomic risk levels was within the same level of risk. The findings may help to develop a noninvasive wearable insole pressure system for the continuous monitoring and automated activity recognition, which could assist researchers and safety managers in identifying and assessing overexertion-related construction activities for minimizing the development of WMSDs' risks among construction workers. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","tags":[],"title":"Construction Activity Recognition and Ergonomic Risk Assessment Using a Wearable Insole Pressure System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yantao Yu","Xincong Yang","Heng Li","Xiaochun Luo","Hongling Guo","Qi Fang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1557014400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557014400,"objectID":"aa315c396a064b478b4d2c9c2a80bb7f","permalink":"https://yantaolab.github.io/publication/yantao20190505asceco/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yantao20190505asceco/","section":"publication","summary":"Construction workers are commonly subjected to ergonomic risks.

One of the major reasons is attributed to high physical demands and hostile working environments. Construction work always requires workers to work for a long duration without sufficient breaks to recover from overexertion and to work under harsh climatic conditions and/or in confined workspaces. Such circumstances can increase the risk of physical fatigue. Traditionally, fatigue monitoring in the construction domain relies on self-reporting or subjective questionnaires. These methods require the manual collection of responses and are impractical for continuous fatigue monitoring. Some researchers have used on-body sensors for fatigue monitoring (such as heart rate monitors and surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors). Although these devices appear to be promising, they are intrusive, requiring sensors to be attached to the worker's body. Such on-body sensors are uncomfortable to wear and could easily cause irritation. Considering the limitations of these methodologies, the current research proposes a novel non-intrusive method to monitor the whole-body physical fatigue with computer vision for construction workers. A computer vision-based 3D motion capture algorithm was developed to model the motion of various body parts using an RGB camera. A fatigue assessment model was developed using the 3D model data from the developed motion capture algorithm and biomechanical analysis. The experiment showed that the proposed physical fatigue assessment method could provide joint-level physical fatigue assessments automatically. Then, a series of experiments demonstrated the potential of the method in assessing the physical fatigue level of different construction task conditions such as site layout and the work-rest schedules.","tags":[],"title":"An automatic and non-invasive physical fatigue assessment method for construction workers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maxwell Fordjour Antwi-Afari","Heng Li","Yantao Yu","Liulin Kong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539648000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539648000,"objectID":"8449cbd8e47bdf69cb206b06cc110542","permalink":"https://yantaolab.github.io/publication/maxwell20181016autcon/","publishdate":"2018-10-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maxwell20181016autcon/","section":"publication","summary":"Awkward working postures are the main risk factor for work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) causing non-fatal occupational injuries among construction workers.

Ten asymptomatic participants performed five different types of awkward working postures (i.e., overhead working, squatting, stooping, semi-squatting, and one-legged kneeling) in a laboratory setting.

The last decade has seen a growing trend toward vision-based activity recognition. However, recognizing workers’ activities in far-field surveillance videos is understudied. This study proposes a hierarchical statistical method for recognizing workers’ activities in far-field surveillance videos. The method consists of two steps. First, a deep action recognition method was used to recognize workers’ actions, and a new fusion strategy was proposed to consider the characteristics of far-field surveillance videos. The deep action recognition method with the new fusion strategy has achieved the comparable performance (0.84 average accuracy) on the far-field surveillance data set in contrast to the original method on the public data sets. Second, a Bayesian nonparametric hidden semi-Markov model was innovatively used to model and infer workers’ activities based on action sequences. The latent states of the fitted Bayesian model captured workers’ activities in terms of state duration distributions and state transition distributions, which are indispensable for understanding workers’ time allocation. It has been preliminarily illustrated that the activity information learned by the Bayesian model possesses the potential to implement objective work sampling, personal physical fatigue monitoring, trade-level health risk assessment, and process-based quality control. Also, the limitations of this study are discussed.","tags":[],"title":"Capturing and Understanding Workers’ Activities in Far-Field Surveillance Videos with Deep Action Recognition and Bayesian Nonparametric Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liulin Kong","Heng Li","Yantao Yu","Hanbin Luo","Martin Skitmore","Maxwell Fordjour Antwi-Afari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535673600,"objectID":"0ba8db13dfd82433f2037cf74fc1a988","permalink":"https://yantaolab.github.io/publication/liulin20180831aei/","publishdate":"2018-08-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/liulin20180831aei/","section":"publication","summary":"Construction workers typically undertake highly demanding physical tasks involving various types of stresses from awkward postures, using excessive force, highly repetitive actions, and excessive energy expenditure, which increases the likelihood of unsafe actions, productivity loss, and human errors. Biomechanical models have been developed to estimate joint loadings, which can help avoid strenuous physical exertion, potentially enhancing construction workforce productivity, safety, and well-being. However, the models used are mainly in 2D, or to predict static strength ignored their velocity and acceleration or using marker-based method for dynamic motion data collection. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework for investigating the mechanical energy expenditure (MEE) of workers using a 3D biomechanical model based on computer vision-based techniques. Human 3D Pose Estimation algorithm based on 2D videos is applied to approximate the coordinates of human joints for working postures, and smart insoles are used to collect foot pressures and plantar accelerations, as input data for the biomechanical analyses. The results show a detailed MEE rate for the whole body, at which joints the maximum and minimum values were obtained to avoid excessive physical exertion. The proposed method can approximate the total daily MEE of construction tasks by summing the assumed cost of individual tasks (such as walking, lifting, and stooping), providing suggestions for the design of a daily workload that workers can sustain without developing cumulative fatigue.","tags":[],"title":"Quantifying the physical intensity of construction workers, a mechanical energy approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xincong Yang","Heng Li","Yantao Yu","Xiaochun Luo","Dongping Cao","Ting Huang","Xu Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535500800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535500800,"objectID":"0f7fcea83285be27c21809bcec4ed801","permalink":"https://yantaolab.github.io/publication/xincong20180829mice/","publishdate":"2018-08-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/xincong20180829mice/","section":"publication","summary":"The spatial characteristics of cracks are significant indicators to assess and evaluate the health of existing buildings and infrastructures. However, the current manual crack description method is time consuming and labor consuming. To improve the efficiency of crack inspection, advanced computer vision-based techniques have been utilized to detect cracks automatically at image level and grid-cell level. But existing crack detections are of (high specificity) low generality and inefficient, in terms that conventional approaches are unable to identify and measure diverse cracks concurrently at pixel level. Therefore, this research implements a novel deep learning technique named fully convolutional network (FCN) to address this problem. First, FCN is trained by feeding multiple types of cracks to semantically identify and segment pixel-wise cracks at different scales. Then, the predicted crack segmentations are represented by single-pixel width skeletons to quantitatively measure the morphological features of cracks, providing valuable crack indicators for assessment in practice, such as crack topology, crack length, max width, and mean width. To validate the prediction, the predicted segmentations are compared with recent advanced method for crack recognition and ground truth. For crack segmentation, the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are 97.96%, 81.73%, 78.97%, and 79.95%, respectively. For crack length, the relative measurement error varies from −48.03% to 177.79%, meanwhile that ranges from −13.27% to 24.01% for crack width. The results show that FCN is feasible and sufficient for crack identification and measurement. Although the accuracy is not as high as CrackNet because of three types of errors, the prediction has been increased to pixel level and the training time has been dramatically decreased to several per cents of previous methods due to the novel end-to-end structure of FCN, which combines typical convolutional neural networks and deconvolutional layers.","tags":[],"title":"Automatic Pixel-Level Crack Detection and Measurement Using Fully Convolutional Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yantao Yu","Heng Li","Xincong Yang","Waleed Umer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1532822400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1532822400,"objectID":"8dcac721055c2a5b5dd86ab40ffe9faa","permalink":"https://yantaolab.github.io/publication/yantao2018isarc/","publishdate":"2018-07-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yantao2018isarc/","section":"publication","summary":" Construction workers are commonly subjected to ergonomic risks due to awkward postures and/or excessive manual material handling. Accurate ergonomic assessment will facilitate ergonomic risk identification and the subsequent mitigation. Traditional assessment methods such as visual observation and on-body sensors rely on subjective judgement and are intrusive in nature. To cope up with the limitations of the existing technologies, a computer vision and smart insole-based joint-level ergonomic work load calculation methodology is proposed for construction workers. Accordingly, this method could provide an objective and detailed ergonomic assessment for various construction tasks. Firstly, construction workers' skeleton data is extracted using a smartphone camera with an advanced deep learning algorithm. Secondly, smart insoles are used to quantify the plantar pressures while the worker performs a construction activity. Finally, the gathered data is fed to an inverse dynamic model in order to calculate the joint torques and workloads. The aforementioned approach was tested with experiment s comprising simulations of material handling, plastering and rebar. The results reveal that the developed methodology has the potential to provide detailed and accurate ergonomic assessment. Overall, this research contributes to the knowledge of occupational safety and health in construction management by providing a novel approach to assess the risk factors of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs).

Work sampling is a widely used method for this task, while suffers from low efficiency as only one worker is selected for each observation. Attentional selection asymmetry can also bias its uniform object selection assumption. Existing vision-based methods are primarily oriented towards recognizing single, separated activities involving few workers or equipment. In this paper, we introduce an activity recognition method, which receives surveillance videos as input and produces diverse and continuous activity labels of individual workers in the field of view. Convolutional networks are used to recognize activities, which are encoded in spatial and temporal streams. A new fusion strategy is developed to combine the recognition results of the two streams. The experimental results show that our activity recognition method has achieved an average accuracy of 80.5%, which is comparable with the state-of-the-art of activity recognition in the computer vision community, given the severe camera motion and low resolution of site surveillance videos and the marginal inter-class difference and significant intra-class variation of workers' activities. We also demonstrate that our method can underpin the implementation of efficient and objective work sampling.

Fully understanding the causes of unsafe behaviors on site will help to prevent them, thus reducing construction accidents. The accurate and timely identification of site workers’ unsafe behaviors can aid in the analysis of the causes of unsafe behaviors and prevention of construction accidents.

Three basic modules are involved, an unsafe behavior database, real-time data collection module, and behavior judgement module. A laboratory test demonstrated the feasibility, efficiency, and accuracy of the method. The method has the potential to improve construction safety management by providing comprehensive data for the systematic identification of the causes to workers’ unsafe behaviors, such as inappropriate management methods, measures or decisions, personal characteristics, work space and time, as well as warning workers identified as behaving unsafely, if necessary.

The complexity and variability of construction sites makes safety management more difficult to implement than in other industries. As a promising technology, visualization has been extensively explored to aid construction safety management. However, a comprehensive critical review of the visualization technology in construction safety management is absent in the literature.\nThis paper provides a comprehensive review to investigate research and development, application methods, achievements and barriers to the use of visualization technology in safety management, and suggests possible future research directions to extend its application. It is found that visualization technology can improve safety management by aiding safety training, job hazard area (JHA) identification and on-site safety monitoring and warnings, but there are barriers or limitations involved. Existing location technologies, for instance, can perform well only in relatively small areas due to their generally poor penetrating performance. Finally, possible future research directions are proposed to benefit the extensive application of visualization technology for construction safety management in both theory and practice.
